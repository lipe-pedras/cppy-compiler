# CP-Py Compiler

This project implements a compiler for a simple C-like programming language named **cppy**, with additional Python-inspired features. The compiler is developed in Python using the PLY library.

## Language Features

The **cppy** language supports:
-   Variable assignment (`=`).
-   Optional type declarations (`int`, `float`, `string`, `char`, `bool`).
-   Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (power).
-   Relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
-   Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.
-   Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
-   Looping statements: `while`.
-   Output command: `print()`.
-   Single-line comments: `//`.
-   Semicolon-terminated statements: `;`.

## Project Structure

-   `lexer.py`: Contains the source code for the lexical analyzer.
-   `parser.py`: Contains the source code for the syntax analyzer and the Python code generator.
-   `compiler.py`: The main script to run the compiler.
-   `*.cppy`: Source code files written in the cppy language.
-   `*.py`: Python files generated by the compiler.
-   `*_tokens.txt`: Files containing the list of recognized tokens for each example.

## Prerequisites

To run the compiler, you need Python 3 and the PLY library installed.

```bash
pip install ply
```

## How to Use the Compiler

The process involves two main stages: "compiling" your `.cppy` file, which translates it and generates a token report, and then executing the translated Python file.

### Compilation

To compile a program, use the `compiler.py` script from your terminal, passing the name of your source file as an argument. The compiler performs two main actions as required by the project specification: it translates the source code into Python and generates a file that recognizes every token in the program.

**Command:**
```bash
python compiler.py your_program.cppy
```
For example, if you have a file named `test.cppy`, you would run:
```bash
python compiler.py test.cppy
```

### Generated Outputs

After running the command above, two new files will be created in your directory:

1.  **`your_program_tokens.txt`**: This file contains a list of all the tokens identified by the lexical analyzer in your source code. Each line shows a token and its classification (identifier, reserved word, operator, etc.), as specified in the assignment requirements.

2.  **`your_program.py`**: This is the executable output of the compilation. It contains your original cppy logic translated into Python code, ready to be executed by the Python interpreter.

### Execution

To run your compiled program, you execute the generated `.py` file using Python. The program's output will be displayed in the terminal.

**Command:**
```bash
python your_program.py
```
Continuing the example, to run the compiled `test.cppy` file, you would use:
```bash
python test.py
```

## Example Programs

The repository includes three sample programs to demonstrate the language's syntax and features.

### `example1.cppy`: Simple Calculator

This program simulates a basic calculator. It demonstrates the use of multiple `if`/`elif`/`else` for operation selection and handles potential errors like division by zero.

### `example2.cppy`: Student Grade System

This example calculates a student's final grade and status based on multiple weighted scores and class attendance. It's a good showcase for complex conditional logic using `and`, `or`, and `not`.

### `example3.cppy`: Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This program generates and prints the terms of the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit. It's an excellent test for the `while` loop and sequential variable updates.
